Me, that's who!\nVery nice place and location with plenty of parking. The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us. Not sure where they derived their version of Mexican food from but whatever, might as well try it. Popcorn as a starter instead of chips and salsa? Um, ok. Never seen that before. I tried the fajitas and they were served and tasted like every other Mexican place I've eaten. Family had the loaded nachos and complained about the soggy chips within. Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as \&quot;nachos\&quot;. Other than that, the pricing was fair and comparable to other places.

Anything and everything you could want.\&quot; \n\nAnd this was by the owner of The Dogs / Amore Dogs / Seadogs restaurants. Yet it was said with such quirky, honest punchiness that it only intrigued me further as to actually ordering the seafood stew.\n\nThe Dogs restaurants all have the same vibe, and menu style. More affordable cuts of meats and ingredients are used so that the prices are kept down on the menu. The food has a slap-dash feel to it, but I meant that in a good way. Like 'these three ingredients go really well together, in a salad - pow there's your dinner!' Rather than being pretentious and picky and calling things joux. It's honest grub. More upmarket than the fish and chip bar but less pompy than the michelin star restaurants...\n\nAnyway. I came here with some friends who were visiting town, one of whom doesn't actually like fish. Luck would have it there was skirt steak on the menu. I noticed they actually have a sign in the window saying \&quot;now with more meat!\&quot; so I think even if any of your party don't like fish there'll be something to satisfy them. The steak, by the way, was really quite delicious and the chips lovely and crisp. I kind of wish I'd ordered it.\n\nBut my fish stew was just what I wanted. I can't do shellfish so it came without, but there were big chunks of white fish (I think white bait?) and little sardines and all sorts of fish swimming (haha) in a rich tomato stew sauce with some veg. A really hearty portion, that filled me up good and proper. Nothing fishy about that.\n\nThe dessert was really quite lovely too. Again, with the 'homely' non-pretentious feel I found it ironic that we had to ask what \&quot;burnt cream\&quot; was to be told it was like \&quot;creme brulee\&quot;. So used are we to pomp! Anyway, the orange burnt cream with proper slices of orange on top was mmm. It wasn't even me that ordered it but give me a spare spoon and you don't want me within 100 yards of you and your dessert.\n\nSo as far as meals out go, this was quite delectable. It isn't fine dining, but nor is it poor quality. It's like good, home-made fare at reasonable prices but very well done. \n\nI prefer the ambience in here to Amore Dogs (still have yet to dine in The Dogs). There's lower lighting, lower ceilings and it feels a bit more intimate. Oh, and the journey to the bathrooms is almost like stepping into the wardrobe in Narnia. Felt like a journey to centre of the earth but was a talking point of our meal for quite some time!\n\nAs I said, it was the owner of The Dogs who was serving us I think (I recognised him from an interview). Quite the character, he wasn't patronising or overly friendly, but he was highly efficient running a tight ship and getting very much involved with our table, our order and our meal. Kudos.\n\nIf I'm in town and need me some fish I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Seadogs.&quot;" user="/106" business="/39"/>

My biggest problem with this restaurant was that my shirt sleeves stuck to the table, how hard is it to wipe a table before customers sit at it?

I like my crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and these were just that.  I've never been a fan of mushy peas and theirs is not going to convince me otherwise.  Now... the fish.  I had the haddock in oats.  The haddock was fine, but the oats, well the coating was soggy and bland.  After seeing the beer battered fish and chips go by my table, I had wished that I had ordered the beer battered version.\n\nI decided to give dessert a go... glad I did!  I ordered the Orange Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding.  I actually don't like orange and chocolate, but I had different version of Bread and Butter Pudding at The Dogs and enjoyed it so much that I figured, this would probably be on that level.  Out it came in a little dish.  A square of bread pudding with a creamy chocolate sauce covering it.  The orange flavour was strong in some parts, but I did not mind it because the Bread and Butter Pudding was heavenly.\n\nI am not sure that I would go back to Seadogs for lunch, I might try it for dinner, but out of the three, The Dogs is still my favourite.&quot;" user="/147" business="/39"/>

Can't get enough of the salty, sea fresh flavours nowadays!\n\nSo my new found passion for all our little fishy friends has led me to develop quite a good talent of sniffing out (or tasting as the case may be) the best seafood restaurants. Seadogs in Edinburgh is definitely up there on my list.\n\nIt is yet another resaurant on Rose Street which has only recently appeared, but gone down a storm with locals and tourists alike. Serving up only vegetarian and seafood options, it has a specialised but interesting menu which includes Scottish favourite cullen skink, and trout to name but a few. It also has the rather exciting whitebait on the menu, which I have only previously tried in Greek restaurants but can report Seadogs do it deliciously!\n\nI can't quite get some of my loved ones to appreciate seafood - think they're a bit scared. But for both the fanatic and the beginner, I would highly recommend Seadogs. I'd be happy to have them aboard my good ship and most definitely wouldn't make them walk the plank. I've still not tried cullen skink, and judging on how tasty this refreshing restaurant is it might be a good plaice (haw haw) to start!&quot;" user="/226" business="/39"/>

The corn was definitely sweet corn and you can find chunks of crab meat in the soup.\n-Chicken spring rolls (fried) - I wish they offered soft and not fried spring rolls, but this is Chinese, not Vietnamese.  It's served with a sweet chili sauce.  I think it's just a piece of chicken wrapped with the eggroll soft wrap and fried.  It was good, nothing special.\n-For entree, I tried the sliced beef tenderloin with pepper sauce (sizzling plate), the chicken with ginger and onions (sizzling plate), and the sweet and sour king prawns.\n   a. the beef tenderloin is served on a sizzling plate with onions.  It was very good, with a tasty semi-thick brown pepper sauce.

I know that most restaurants in the UK are priced for tourists, but I still think they should at least deliver quality to the price tag they're advertising. This one does not.\n\nOh, this place also refused to allow me to take home any leftovers in any form. Also a UK thing that I am aware is *somewhat* uncommon but it's not illegal and I do not see how hard it is to invest in some takeaway cartons for people to take home leftovers. I asked and then the waitress would only offer to let me take my pasta home in a dirty ice cream tub. Um, no thanks.&quot;" user="/149" business="/59"/>

Requirements: Hearty food, on a budget + veggie options.\n\nA number of my favourite haunts made the short-list, but in the end I opted for Moo &amp; I'm very glad I did!\n\nEvery Friday evening, Moo hold a burger night and it's BYOB (with no corkage fee!). The restaurant advertises the night as running from 6pm 'til 9pm, but on booking, the owner was happy to agree that we could use the venue after this time. Our table reservation was for 8pm and we stayed until just after 10pm. The staff didn't rush us at all &amp; we had an excellent time.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe burger night portions at Moo are very generous and we were full to the brim on leaving. The menu offers a choice of no-fuss starters (garlic bread, soup, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, coleslaw &amp; salad) and a selection of five main course burger toppings that can be served with a beef, chicken or bean burger. All main courses are served with salad, coleslaw and a portion of seriously tasty hand-cut, homemade chips.\n\nI opted for a chicken burger, topped with bacon &amp; Mull of Kintyre cheddar - it was absolutely delicious. The only disappointment was that the bread was rather ordinary. Tasty rolls from a local Edinburgh bakery would bump my rating up to 5 stars.\n\nThe service:\n\nThe owners and other staff at Moo are friendly, helpful and attentive. \n\nOriginally, I'd booked our table for 8.30pm, but moved our reservation to 8pm at quite short notice - the restaurant had no issue at all with this.\n\nThe Moo website had unfortunately been hacked and the burger menu was unavailable to download (issue now resolved), but within a few minutes of coming off the phone, the owner had emailed a copy to me, so that I could share it with friends.\n \nWe brought along a selection of prosecco, white wine &amp; red wine (from the wonderful Cornelius on Easter Road) and as Moo charge no corkage fee this made a massive difference to the total bill; a very pocket-friendly &#xa3;8 per head!\n\nFor hearty food on a budget, I highly recommend burger nights at Moo Cafeteria.\n\nMoo can be reached by bus on the #23, #27 and #8 routes and is well-placed for after dinner drinks in Canonmills, Broughton Street &amp; Stockbridge.&quot;" user="/90" business="/48"/>

Whether you see that as an indication of how good this place is, or of how sad I am is up to you... but you should definitely eat there before you decide.\n\nWe went for their 2-Course lunch deal for &#xa3;5.95, as we just happened to be walking past and were given a flyer. We did not regret it... although I am now extremely full!\n\nI usually steer clear of indian restaurants as I often find the food can be very greasy and stodgy, and very often it all tastes the same. None of that is true about this place: the starter is automatically brought to you (you don't get to choose it yourself), although the waiter did ask us if we were vegetarians first. He brought us thinly sliced potatoes which had been fried in a lovely combination of spices until crispy, although I'm not going to pretend for a second that I know what they were. Alongside these we each got a huge chunk of tandoori grilled chicken and an equally massive chunk of chicken marinated in their own unique spice blend, with a side salad and home-made raita.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the selection of mains or my boyfriend's almond and saffron lassi which was the ultimate winner, but the mains definitely played a huge part in it: there was a buffet with 4 different curry dishes - a tadka dal, a tandoori lamb curry, a veggie sweet potato &amp; spinach curry and the best one of all... chicken cooked with cashew nut paste, roast tomatoes, garlic and green chillies. Oh. Yes.\n\nOf course, this all came with an unlimited supply of green salad, home-made mango chutney, 2 flavours of home-made poppadums and as much home-made naan bread as you can eat. As for the lassi, you need to go and try that for yourself - at &#xa3;1.75 it's an absolute steal.\n\nThe best thing about all this was the bill. For two of us to eat more than, in all probability, was healthy for that time of the day, a lassi, a beer and large bottle of mineral water we paid just &#xa3;17.\n\nIf you like indian food, or even think you might do but you're still not sure, I can't recommend this place highly enough.&quot;" user="/183" business="/61"/>

Again I feel like so many of the complaints about vegetarian places seem to confuse the fact that a place can be crap, like crap service and or crap cleanliness or crap food, regardless of it being vegetarian. In fact if the Forest Cafe did serve animal then its faults would be worse, for reasons we will come to. But for whats it's worth I don't agree with the fundamentalist view that  has been aired that animals were \&quot;put on Earth\&quot; to be eaten by humans (and I think most scientists would agree). I appreciate it's vegetarian/vegan stance, if nothing else its one more place vegetarians can go without having to worry about what's in their food. And as I have alluded to in other reviews, I'm sure meat eaters can still appreciate the occasional meat free dish in principal. Thus I don't find the fact that the Forest is vegetarian/vegan in itself to be a valid criticism (and suggesting vegetarianism is synonymous with hippyism is also ridiculous).\n\nANYWAY if you hadn't guessed from my ramblings already the Forest is a vegetarian cafe, as well as a meeting spot and venue. It's also volunteer run. As others have mentioned there is a sort of  \&quot;hippy\&quot;, New Age aesthetic, although both those words are pretty meaningless.\n\nSo what are my problems with the Forest? My first is hygiene. Whilst the food can be just fine, and it's cheap too, the number of times I have been served dishes that have been lying out for too long, or the tables haven't been wiped in a long while. Can you see my point about meat now? The toilets have also been less than appealing on certain occasions in the past.\n\nThese are the sorts of things that bother me. I love that the Forest is volunteer run, I love that it's very liberal and relaxed about most, but those things need not be synonymous with disorganisation and uncleanliness. If anything that just furthers a stereotype that pervades some of these other reviews. My only other complaint is that whilst the Forest can be, as I have mentioned, a wonderfully open and easy going place where anyone can voice their opinion, it can contradictorily be a bit cliquey. I have found that some nights, during discussions and meetings, there are certain well known individuals who drown out and mock dissenting voices. It is the New Age eco dogmatic view in particular which seems to prevail without as much criticism as its deserves. Having said this, the Forest remains largely unhierarchal. And at how many other cafes can you even attend meeting and voice such opinions on how they are run in the first place?\n\nThe one thing I love and respect about the Forest is that you can go in and spend as much time as you like in there without buying a thing. How many places let you do that? I was recently thrown out of a pub after fifteen minutes of not buying anything while I was waiting for someone, and I was one of only three people in there! I like the Forest's stance on just being a place to \&quot;hang\&quot; if you so choose.\n\nSo whilst the Forest has so many great things going for it, there is room for improvement. Those anarchists and communitarians that use the Forest as a meeting place, should especially mind their own proclamations of unhierarchal social organisation, and its compatibility with order and effectiveness. The Forest needs to be a little more ordered and effective!&quot;" user="/103" business="/55"/>

For a main course I had Tiger prawns with asparagus, garlic and soy sauce, which was beautifully flavoured. The other dishes were all good but their seafood is definitely the speciality. The only problem is that it is expensive, the seafood dishes averaging about &#xa3;13, not including rice.

I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.\n\nI looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: \&quot;top notch\&quot; and \&quot;entirely faultless\&quot; service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.\n\nThe menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!\n\nI booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for &#xa3;12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. \n\nThai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... \n\nFor &#xa3;30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, \&quot;flawless\&quot;.

The restaurant is rather open plan and, if sitting downstairs, you can see the chefs hard at work with their huge pizza oven. The staff are friendly but the restaurant can lack atmosphere if there aren't too many diners. When it's busy the service can be slow, but this is perhaps only to be expected.

It's really not a large place. The restaurant has about 8 tables with 2 tables of 4. Best you make a reservation on the weekend, as they seem very busy, no doubt.

Having said this, you definitely get your money worth of quality. \nI ordered a fillet carpaccio with ruccola as a starter, veal in bread crumbs alla milanese (served with capers,  slices of lemon and anchovies) as a main and vanilla ice cream with amaretto as dessert. And yes, I still wonder how I ate it all :-) \nEach of these dishes was served to its highest standards.  I still taste the soft and perfectly cut carpaccio with a hint of lemon or the amaretto touched vanilla ice cream perfectly proportioned. \nThe waiters were all Italian and efficient.

The same must be for the menus as it literally is printed on A4 paper and stapled together! Paper table cloths and no music. The waitress had chunky black plastic glasses on with no lenses in them, fine as a fashion statement or in a themed restaurant but maybe not whilst working? \n\nI opted for tofu and pineapple with noodles and my husband had chicken in a black bean sauce and fried rice.

The fried rice served in a bamboo box was fun and kept the rice hot to go back to. \n\nAnyway, we were three quarters through out meal when a mother and daughter who were also dinning started a disgruntled discussion with the manager that very quickly got louder and more involved, the manager was very composed and asked to discuss aside etc but the woman was now shouting and frankly disturbing every other diner.

Seadogs has that nice clean, straight to the point look, and those adjectives apply to the speedy service and the seafood dishes, served straight up with a twist.\n\nThis is a pretty snazzy little place to eat considering how reasonable the prices are. With food coming in at four pounds something on the lunch menu, you'd expect portions to be mini, but I actually found them to be fairly generous. I ate like a greedy king (queen doesn't work as well), chomping on warm bread and butter while sipping very reasonably priced prosecco, followed by some coronation mussels and an amazing portion of fish and chips. I did share some of this, I might add. The range of fish and chips options here are really awesome, with trout, hake, coley and whitebait all candidates to be wrapped in beer batter or oatmeal. The focus really is entirely seafood with a hint of vegetarian, so don't come here expecting other meat options, but do come here if you like really good food of the fishy variety, served in a relaxed atmosphere.&quot;" user="/158" business="/39"/>

The restaurant looks pretty small from the outside, but inside it stretches back quite far and is able to accommodate a lot of customers. \n\nSuruchi's menu offers a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine and I ordered the seafood soup to start which was truly amazing - made with really fresh ingredients and tasted super fresh - yummy! I then had the butter chicken for my main which was equally as amazing and the chicken was cooked perfectly and there was no excess layer of oil on the sauce which I sometimes find with Indian dishes. There are warnings on the menu indicating which dishes are mild and which are hot which always gets a big thumbs up from me as you won't get your head blown off by an unexpected chili. \n\nThe prices are really reasonable here with most main meal curry's costing about six pounds, and there is a lunch deal available too where a two course meal costs &#xa3;6 - what a bargain!

The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller, with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back.  They serve the normal cafe range of items - drinks, small cakes, and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as well.\n\nStaff greeted me with a smile, and though I only bought one small piece of cake, I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food.  I find the shops on Elm Row are so easy to miss, as they are set back from the road, but if you venture in, you'll find gems like this.\n\nThis is the sort of handy little place you'll want to keep coming back to.

Seafood, on the other hand, is a different story - not only is it up there among my absolute favourites, I'm also very high maintenance when it comes to getting it right. And I love Seadogs.\n\nMy friend told me about it, so I convinced him he wanted to take me there for lunch. It was a great idea he had. The ethos is fairly simple.. the dishes on the menu are either competely veggie (such as the broccoli,cauliflower and mustard crumble), or are seafood-based (like the smoked coley kedgeree). They're made with ingredients that are a) seasonal and b) local, and so you can't really go wrong in my book. Foodies who are into their fancy cuisine will be suitable impressed, and people who just want a good, well-made fish and chips will also be happy.\n\nMy one piece of advice... if you know you've got a sweet tooth but not a huge appetite, don't fill up on your main course like I did. I had to sit and watch my friend eat his deep-fried chocolate cake served with home-made ice cream across the table. Looking very smug, and only giving me a tiny piece.

Nice starters, I had the mushroom risotto balls. Delicious little bundles of flavour with a soft, gooey mozzarella middle. Yum! Exactly the lip smacking yummy food you want from an Italian restaurant.\n\nDo you like Peroni? I do, and they do three varieties; three! They have your common or garden, Nastro Azzurro and Gran Reserva. Naturally I had to try all three, each of which were perfect. Their wine menu was more than acceptable too.\n\nFor main, I had some twisty little pasta with Italian sausage, ham, a shave of cheese and some chilli butter. Again, food that makes you feel like you've been wrapped up in a warm blanket. I think it needed a little more mositure though, it was a bit heavy going once you were towards the end of the plate, but I suspect that is personal choice.\n\nWe also had a plate full of spaghetti pomodoro, which is a simple and perfect as it gets, and the reward was scrummy flavours, all of which tasted fresh and well cooked.

Well, Moo gave me the latter, with smaller balls, which had clearly been checked before being sent out to me.

  <yelp:Review r_id="mxq-Dx6I4O-csiC8JDgsgA" date="2010-07-09T00:00:00.000+0200" stars="3.0" text="&quot;I'd heard a lot about the Forest Cafe, which is a strictly vegetarian cafe situated right next to George Square!\n\nThe staff are mainly volunteers and a friend of mine had been saintly enough to work a few shifts. When I heard they had a Swedish dessert as well as a Nigerian stew on the menu, I felt this place was beckoning me (I'm a citizen of both countries!). Sadly, both delicacies were off the menu by the time I got there, but I was still quite impressed.\n\nThe menu is quite impressive with a variety of sandwiches and salads, and as all the food is made by partially untrained volunteers, the presentation is quite rustic (real Food Channel lingo here!).. I had a falafel burger, which tasted alrightttt, but for the menu, which is a bit.. well leafey, and pricey for my taste, I'd say it's the atmosphere of the Forest Cafe that's really special. \n\nAfter a few minutes in here, you forget about the sun was shining outside a few minutes ago; it's definitely got a grungy (but clean!) to it. If I were allowed to bring my own food and hang out in here all day, I'd probably be there more often than I am.&quot;" user="/114" business="/55"/>
